This is an example of how to create a reponsive navbar using vanilla javascript

I created a simple navbar which focus first on mobile screens.

The navbar is a dropdown menu which is shown when the user click in hamburger menu
On resize we can see a transition between the states used in different device screens

You can find in the js file how I handled the click event that shows and hide the menu on mobile screnns
